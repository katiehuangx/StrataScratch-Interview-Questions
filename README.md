### ðŸ“Œ Meta/Facebook | Popularity of Hack
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10061-popularity-of-hack?code_type=1) Meta/Facebook has developed a new programing language called Hack.To measure the popularity of Hack they ran a survey with their employees. The survey included data on previous programing familiarity as well as the number of years of experience, age, gender and most importantly satisfaction with Hack. Due to an error location data was not collected, but your supervisor demands a report showing average popularity of Hack by office location. Luckily the user IDs of employees completing the surveys were stored.

Based on the above, find the average popularity of the Hack per office location. Output the location along with the average popularity.

```sql
SELECT 
  e.location, 
  AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM facebook_employees e
INNER JOIN facebook_hack_survey s
  ON e.id = s.employee_id
GROUP BY e.location;
```

Note: _The official solution has only 1 retrieved record, however the question did not specifically request for the solution to be limited to one. Upon browsing the Solution Discussion, other users also found the official solution to be incorrect and it should be without `LIMIT 1`. For the sake of solving the question, I'm limiting my retrieved records to 1 record._

### ðŸ“Œ Amazon | Finding User Purchases
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10322-finding-user-purchases?code_type=1) Write a query that'll identify returning active users. A returning active user is a user that has made a second purchase within 7 days of any other of their purchases. Output a list of user_ids of these returning active users.

I'm going to build this query and show you the results as I go. 

Step 1: Pull all the records with the next date when the user makes their second, third, etc purchases
```sql
SELECT 
  id, user_id, created_at,
  LEAD(created_at) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at) AS next_date
FROM amazon_transactions
```

<img width="656" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/172988726-8b9fa90d-ff2b-4df8-acfa-4ec82e15a825.png">

user_id 100 makes their first purchase on 2020-03-07 and a second purchase on 2020-03-13.

```sql
-- Method 1: Using a CTE
WITH next_date_cte AS (
  SELECT 
      id, 
      user_id, 
      created_at,
      LEAD(created_at) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at) AS next_date
  FROM amazon_transactions)

SELECT 
  DISTINCT user_id
FROM next_date_cte
WHERE (next_date - created_at) < 7 -- Filter results to purchases made within 7 days
```

```sql
-- Method 2: Using a Subquery
SELECT 
  DISTINCT user_id
FROM 
  (SELECT 
    id, 
    user_id, 
    created_at,
    LEAD(created_at) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at) AS next_date
  FROM amazon_transactions) AS subquery
WHERE (next_date - created_at) < 7;
```

### ðŸ“Œ Amazon | Highest Cost Orders
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/9915-highest-cost-orders?code_type=1) Find the customer with the highest daily total order cost between 2019-02-01 to 2019-05-01. If customer had more than one order on a certain day, sum the order costs on daily basis. Output customer's first name, total cost of their items, and the date. For simplicity, you can assume that every first name in the dataset is unique.

I took some time with this as I tried solving it with 1 CTE, but I couldn't and ended up with 2 CTEs. Not my most elegant solution, but it works. 

```sql
-- Method 1: Using CTE
WITH daily_order AS (
SELECT DISTINCT c.first_name, SUM(o.total_order_cost) OVER (PARTITION BY c.first_name, o.order_date) AS total_cost, o.order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
    ON c.id = o.cust_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2019-02-01' AND '2019-05-01'),
ranked AS (
SELECT first_name, total_cost, order_date, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_cost DESC) AS ranking
FROM daily_order)

SELECT first_name, total_cost, order_date
FROM ranked
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

```sql
-- Method 2: Using subquery
SELECT 
  first_name, total_cost, order_date
FROM 
-- Subquery #1
  (SELECT 
    first_name, total_cost, order_date, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_cost DESC) AS ranking
  FROM  
  -- Subquery #3
      (SELECT 
        DISTINCT c.first_name, 
        SUM(o.total_order_cost) OVER (PARTITION BY c.first_name, o.order_date) AS total_cost, 
        o.order_date
      FROM customers c
      LEFT JOIN orders o
        ON c.id = o.cust_id
      WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2019-02-01' AND '2019-05-01'
      ) AS daily_order
  ) AS ranked -- Name of Subquery #1
WHERE ranking = 1;
